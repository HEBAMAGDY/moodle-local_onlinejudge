THIS PLUGIN IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Online Judge 2 is a local plugin for Moodle 2.x. It provides a class library, 
called judgelib, to assess submitted source code automatically by testing them
against customized test cases (ACM-ICPC/Online Judge style). By calling this lib, 
all kinds of moodle plugins can get the ability of online judge.

Now, OJ2 includes an Online Judge Assignment Type which works like the offical
Advanced Uploading of Files except the ability of online judge. To install it,
run the following command in command line, and the current directory must be
onlinejudge2

ln -s ../../../local/onlinejudge2/clients/mod/assignment/type/onlinejudge/ ../../mod/assignment/type/
