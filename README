THIS PLUGIN IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Online Judge 2 is a local plugin for Moodle 2.x. It provides a base lib, called
judgelib, to assess submitted source code automatically by testing them against
customizable test cases (ACM-ICPC/Online Judge style). By calling this lib, 
all kinds of moodle plugins can get the ability of online judge.

Now, OJ2 includes an Online Judge Assignment Type which works like the offical
Advanced Uploading of Files except the ability of online judge.
